# ValueOrientedRiskManagementInsurance

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkriele/ValueOrientedRiskManagementInsurance.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkriele/ValueOrientedRiskManagementInsurance.jl)

**The code in this package is work in progress and does not yet work as intended.**

When this package is finished it will provide example calculations for the second edition of the book _Wertorientiertes Risikomanagement von Versicherungsunternehmen_ (to be published) as well as future editions of its English translation, _Value-Oriented Risk Management of Insurance Companies_.

This package is written for Julia 0.3.x.  In its current form it will incur warnings for Julia 0.4 prerelease, and it will not work for later versions of Julia.  An update is planned once Julia 0.4.0 is released.
