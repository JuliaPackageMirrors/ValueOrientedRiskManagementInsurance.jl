This package provides example calculations for the second edition
of the book
 _Wertorientiertes Risikomanagement von Versicherungsunternehmen_
 (to be published in early 2016) as well as future editions of its English
 translation,
 _Value-Oriented Risk Management of Insurance Companies_.

 The package consists of 4 distinct illustrations:

 - An extremely simplified example of the SST (Swiss Solvency
   Test) calculation for life insurance
 - A simplified example of the S2 (Solvency 2) calculation for
   non-life insurance
 - A simplified example of the S2 calculation for life insurance
 - An extremely simplified example of an internal economic capital
   model for non-life insurance. In the book, this model is used
   to illustrate concepts in value based management.

This package is written for Julia 0.4.x.  Newer versions of Julia
may generate errors or warnings.
